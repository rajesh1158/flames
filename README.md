Popular Indian game of FLAMES


This is a popular game of FLAMES. The input to the code is a pair of names. Usually, one name is a boy's name and the other is a female name. You have to keep striking the common alphabets between the two names (only one matching alphabet can be striked at one time).

After striking the common letters, count the total number of remaining letters in both names. For example, if it is 6, then in the word FLAMES, strike the 6th letter. In this case, it is 'S'. Then keep moving forward and strike the next 6th letter. After 'S', moving forward takes us to 'F', then 'L' and so on till we reach the 6th letter, which is now 'F' (because 'S' is aleady striked). Strike 'F'. Then, moving forward another 6 letters, we reach 'A' and strike it. Finally, we will be left with only 'M'.

Each letter in FLAMES stands for:

F - Friend
L - Lover
A - Attracted
M - Married
E - Enemy
S - Sister

So, go try this with your name and the name of that one special person whom you like secretly ;)

Included are Java and PHP implementations.
